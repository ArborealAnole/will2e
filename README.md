# will2e — Assorted (somewhat historic) LaTeX2e packages

The packages in this collection were largely written in my PhD years.

In some cases, they duplicate functionality which now exists (in improved form) in the LaTeX3 expl3 programming environment.

In other cases, the functionality provided is of little general interest as it was written either for my own amusement or to satisfy some unusual requirement.

One or two probably see continued use here and there.

While I'm happy to continue to maintain these packages to some degree they shouldn't be considered ‘under development’ in any real sense.
