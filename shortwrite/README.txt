______________________
The SHORTWRITE package

Silly little package to formalise how to write abbreviations. Still needs proper documentation, and a proper package.

Currently supported macros:

 - \eg   \Eg
 - \ie   \Ie
 - \cf   \Cf
 - \etc
 - \etal
 - \vs

Who knows, I might never even turn this into a real package.

shortwrite.sty may be distributed under the LPPL:
