The addlines package
====================

This package provides the command `\addlines` for adding
or removing space in the textblock of the page it's
used on. E.g., adding an extra line of text to the page
so that a section fits better on the next page.

It will also add space to the *facing* page in a
two-sided document, and two-column documents are also supported.

See `addlines.pdf` for more commands and additional info.
