The SUBDEPTH package
====================

* 2018/12/31 v0.2

## Overview

This package uses some Donald Arseneau code to unify the heights
of math subscripts regardless of the presence of a superscript above.
Compare $M_n$ to $M_n'$ in regular LaTeX for why this can be desirable.

Further details can be found in the PDF documentation.
