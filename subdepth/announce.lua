  * Reworked algorithms to provide better placements in general; the original algorithm
    gave a little too much space between subscript and superscript.
  * Package option `low-sup` now works far more reliably/usefully.
  * New package option `high-sup` for those who value consistency more than beauty.
  * Fine-tuning final placements now possible with `\subdepth{...}` keyval options.
